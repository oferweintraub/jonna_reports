2. **Post-War Focus**: National survival, military preparedness, collective resilience

## Persistent Topics with Transformed Perspectives

### Institutional Trust
- Pre-War: Abstract discussions about democratic legitimacy
- Post-War: Concrete assessments of institutional performance during crisis

- Post-War: Information dissemination, national morale, strategic communication

## Psychological and Social Implications

### Discourse Characteristics

- Increased emphasis on collective experience
- Higher tolerance for institutional authority

## Quantitative Discourse Shift

### Popularity Score Transformations
- Security-related topics: Increased from 35-55 to 72-85

- Geopolitical discussions: Significantly more prominent

## Critical Analysis

### Underlying Dynamics
- War acts as a powerful narrative reset mechanism
- Existential threat temporarily suspends internal political divisions
- Collective trauma reshapes public communication priorities

## Conclusion

The discourse transformation reflects not just a change in topics, but a fundamental recalibration of national priorities, moving from internal institutional debates to a more unified, survival-oriented collective narrative.

## Methodology Note

Topics were extracted using advanced NLP techniques and analyzed for both mainstream and emerging discussions. 
Special attention was paid to low-popularity topics (below 25% popularity) as they often indicate emerging trends 
or subtle shifts in public discourse that might become more significant over time. The popularity score reflects 
the relative prominence of each topic in the analyzed tweets, but importance is not solely determined by popularity.
