Special attention was paid to low-popularity topics (below 25% popularity) as they often indicate emerging trends 
or subtle shifts in public discourse that might become more significant over time. The popularity score reflects 
the relative prominence of each topic in the analyzed tweets, but importance is not solely determined by popularity.</div>
